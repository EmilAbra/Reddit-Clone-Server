  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `User` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to drop the column `email` on the `User` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - The primary key for the `Post` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to drop the column `authorId` on the `Post` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `content` on the `Post` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `published` on the `Post` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - Made the column `name` on table `User` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
  - Added the required column `body` to the `Post` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
